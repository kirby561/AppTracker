# App Tracker

## What is it
App Tracker keeps track of what's running over time and persists it.
The intent is to just leave it running in the background so you can keep track of which apps you use and your playtime in games and such.
You can export your data to CSV so you can look at it in a spreadsheet or just back it up somewhere.

## Compilation
App Tracker is built using VS2015.  Just open the solution file and press build.
